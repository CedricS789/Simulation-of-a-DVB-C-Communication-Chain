\section*{Introduction}{\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Introduction}}
	This project focuses on designing and simulating a Digital Video Broadcasting Cable transmission chain using Matlab.
	The main goal is to model and analyze the components of a typical modem. The first part of this project includes establishing an optimal communication chain over an ideal Additive White Gaussian Noise channel, mapping the signal into symbols, Nyquist filtering, and evaluating the performance of the system through Bit Error Rate simulations for Quadrature Amplitude Modulation signals. The second part revolves around the design and assessment of time and frequency synchronization algorithms. This encompasses evaluating the impact of synchronization errors such as carrier phase and frequency offset and sample time shift. The algorithms used for this purpose are the Gardner Algorithm for time recovery, and a differential cross-correlator for joint frame and frequency acquisition. Afterwards, their effectiveness is demonstrated \textcolor{red}{through convergence analysis and residual error evaluation (double check)}. \textcolor{red}{The study also explores phase interpolation techniques to mitigate remaining phase drifts. Finally, the project aims to validate the simulated chain through real-life experimentation on a Hybrid Fiber-Coax setup using Adalm-Pluto hardware, and to compare the simulated performance with experimental observations.}
